Please submit your own code and do not share your solutions with anyone. You can discuss the concept with other students but always write your own code.
For copied submissions: If two students copy a code and the code earns 8/10 marks, each student will get 4 marks for their submission.
Note that changing variable names and moving statements around does not mean that code is original. It can be easily identified and will be subject to the rule described above.
Solve each problem below in a separate .cpp file named problem1.cpp and problem2.cpp respectively and upload to your repository on Github.

Homework Problems:
1. Write a C++ program that contains a recursive function that returns the sum of squares of 1 through n where n > 0. Give pre- and post-conditions as commented text in your C++ file. Call the function in the program to test it.
2. Write a C++ program that contains a recursive function that prints the digits of a positive decimal integer in reverse order. Give pre- and post-conditions as commented text in your C++ file. Call the function in the program to test it.
