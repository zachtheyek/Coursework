Read in our data from `DistanceHome`.
```{r}
library(readr)
DistanceHome <- read_csv("DistanceHome.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
attach(DistanceHome)
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
# Count the number of M vs F in Sex
tally(~Sex)
```
As we can see, there is a slight inbalance in M vs F.
```{r}
# Compute the mean & stdev for M vs F
mean(Distance~Sex)
sd(Distance~Sex)
```

```{r}
# Visualize Distance(Sex) as a dot plot
dotplot(Distance~Sex)
```
It appears that both M and F follow normal distributions. Hence, we proceed as follows.
```{r}
t.test(Distance~Sex)
```
Notice that the confidence interval contains 0, which is our null hypothesis (H_0: mean_M - mean_F = 0). Hence, we fail to reject the null. 
```{r}
boxplot(Distance~Sex)
```
