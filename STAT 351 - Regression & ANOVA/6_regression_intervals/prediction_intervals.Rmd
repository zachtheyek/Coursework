Read in the data.
```{r}
library(readr)
MidtermFinal <- read_csv("MidtermFinal.csv")
attach(MidtermFinal)
```
From the data, we fit a linear model, where x=midterm grades, and y=final grades. 

Then, select a random x-value to be our critical x-value, and calculate the CI for the mean of the response (mu_y) given that critical value.
```{r}
model = lm(Final~Midterm)
x = data.frame(Midterm = 41)
predict.lm(model, x, interval = "confidence")
```
Notice that our point estimate is located at 79.8646, with an interval of $\mu_y \in (76.02267, 83.70652)$.

We can do the same for the predicted y ($\hat{y}$) given the same critical value, using a prediction interval. 
```{r}
predict.lm(model, x, interval = "prediction")
```
Indeed, we find that we have an interval of $\hat{y} \in (59.75512, 99.97408)$, with a point estimate of 79.8646.
