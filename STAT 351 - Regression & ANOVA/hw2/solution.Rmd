Read in the data.
```{r}
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("data.csv")
attach(data)
data
```
1. Let x = resting pulse, y = active pulse.
```{r}
plot(ActivePulse~RestingPulse)
model = lm(ActivePulse~RestingPulse)
abline(model)
```
2. Equation: ActivePulse = 79.0217 + RestingPulse * 0.4793
```{r}
summary(model)
```
3. Resting pulse: 71

4. Active Pulse: 92

5. From model, predicted ActivePulse = 79.0217 + 71 * 0.4793 = 113

6. Computing the residuals of our data
```{r}
model$residuals
```
```{r}
hist(model$residuals)
```
7. No, because a resting pulse of 100 BPM is outside the range of our model's training data (i.e. we would need to perform extrapolation).
