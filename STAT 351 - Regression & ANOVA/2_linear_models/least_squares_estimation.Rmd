Read in the data containing midterm & final scores for some sample of students.
```{r}
library(readr)
MidtermFinal <- read_csv("Documents/Coursework/STAT 351 - Regression & ANOVA/MidtermFinal.csv")
attach(MidtermFinal)
```
We want to use midterm scores to predict final scores, i.e. predictor: Midterm, and response: Final. 

Plot the relationship between midterm & final scores to verify any correlations.
```{r}
plot(Final~Midterm)
abline(h = mean(Final))
```
Compute the mean of the final scores.
```{r}
mean(Final)
```
Notice that the mean of the final scores does not fit the Midterm-Final relationship well. A better method would be trying to minimize the SSE using least-squares estimation.

Fit a linear model to the data & compute the coefficients.
```{r}
lm(Final~Midterm)
```
```{r}
model = lm(Final~Midterm)
summary(model)
```
```{r}
plot(Final~Midterm)
abline(model)
```
Much better!
