Read in the data containing midterm & final scores for some sample of students.
```{r}
library(readr)
MidtermFinal <- read_csv("MidtermFinal.csv")
attach(MidtermFinal)
```
We want to use midterm scores to predict final scores, i.e. predictor: Midterm, and response: Final. 

Plot the relationship between midterm & final scores to verify linearity. Superimpose the mean final scores as a frame of reference. 
```{r}
plot(Final~Midterm)
abline(h=mean(Final))
```
Compute the mean of the final scores.
```{r}
mean(Final)
```
Notice that the mean of the final scores does not fit the Midterm-Final relationship well. A better method would be trying to minimize the SSE using least-squares estimation.

Fit a linear model to the data & compute the coefficients.
```{r}
lm(Final~Midterm)
```
```{r}
model = lm(Final~Midterm)
summary(model)
```
```{r}
anova(model)
```
We'll revisit ANOVA in more detail later on in the course, but it's interesting to see here that the model summary produces the same p-value as the ANOVA of the model.

Since the p-value is so close to 0, we can assume our fit is sufficiently good. We'll visualize the fit w.r.t. the data to verify.
```{r}
plot(Final~Midterm)
abline(model)
```
Indeed, the model appears to fit the data well.

Finally, we retroactively verify that the conditions for simple linear models are satisfied. We begin by plotting the residuals of the model against the fitted values.
```{r}
plot(model$residuals~model$fitted.values)
abline(h=0)
```
Notice, the residuals are well dispersed about the zero-line, with no signs of clustering or grouping, nor any trends like fanning or tailing. This satisfies the zero mean & constant variance (a.k.a. homoscedasticity) conditions.

Next, we verify the condition of normality by plotting a histogram of the residuals.
```{r}
hist(model$residuals)
```
Indeed, the residuals appear normal, thus satisfying the condition. 

Note that alternatively, we could use a Normal Q-Q plot to achieve the same effect. 
```{r}
plot(model)
```
Since the residuals closely follow the dashed line, we conclude that the condition for normality is satisfied (consistent with our findings using the histogram of residuals).

Notice, in the same function call, we also get the plot of residuals vs fitted!
