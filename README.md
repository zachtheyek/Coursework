This is a repository for all the code I write for classes (notes, homeworks, projects, etc.).

# Course Descriptions
### CSIT 121 - Computer Science I
Hands-on exposure to the following major topics: Problem solving, algorithm design and development, structure of the program, top-down design and functional decomposition, debugging, elementary data types, expressions, I/O functions and formats, repetition and control structures, user-defined functions, pass by value, pass by reference, built-in functions, arrays, strings.

### CSIT 221 - Computer Science II
Hands-on exposure to major topics in data structures and control, including file I/O; abstract data types; static and dynamic data structures; pointers and pointer operations; templates, memory addresses; garbage collection; memory leak; function and operator overloading; constructors and destructors; deep and shallow copying; class concepts; multi-dimensional and dynamic arrays; linked lists; doubly-linked lists; stacks, queues and their implementations and applications. The course provides a computer laboratory component to ensure practice with the above concepts.
